# CMS-K and K-Screens

SE Project

## Setting up the webserver
1. Install MAMP as webserver (http://downloads4.mamp.info/MAMP-PRO-WINDOWS/releases/3.3.1/MAMP_MAMP_PRO_3.3.1.exe)
5. Install nodeJS (https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.11.1/node-v6.11.1-x64.msi)
6. Install grunt-cli (npm install -g grunt-cli)
7. Type "npm install" to download the dependencies
8. Type "grunt run" to trigger the build process
9. Set the newly created www-folder as root directory for your webserver
11. Enter localhost on Google Chrome

Remarks: nodeJS is only needed to create the www-folder. Once built you only need that one to upload to your Apache server.
